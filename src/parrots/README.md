# Parrot

Strictly speaking, a [parrot](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/parrot) is a
bird that mimics speech and other things. In this case, parrots are mock
implementations for certain AWS services for local usage within tests or the
local development server. They are obviously not seagulls, but mimic behavior.
